This is a network-based voice messaging application that allows devices on the same Local Area Network (LAN) to send and receive audio messages — like a local voicemail system.

## 🔧 Features

- Voice message recording and playback
- Device-to-device message delivery over LAN using socket programming
- Lightweight user interface for easy use

1. Make sure all devices are on the same LAN
2. Run the server script on one device
3. Run the client script or app on other devices
4. Record a message and send it — it will be delivered instantly over the network

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- [Your language] (e.g., Python, C#, Java)
- Socket programming
- Audio handling library: [e.g., PyAudio, NAudio, etc.]
- GUI framework: [e.g., Tkinter, WinForms, etc.]
